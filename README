This package provides the ability to capture packets from, and inject packets onto, network interfaces. It supports commonly 
found protocols such as Ethernet, PPP, IP, ARP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

Supported Platforms

pycap should work on any platform that supports libpcap, libnet and Python. 
It currently requires Python 2.3. It will be backported to Python 2.2 if enough interest is shown. If you find any bugs please report them on the
here.

To Do

Packet injection is currently a work in progress. It works for me, but needs a lot more testing. 
A full list of things left to complete is available
on a separate page.

Page will be updated with time.
